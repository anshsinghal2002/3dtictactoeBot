# Self Grading Assessment

---

## Scope/Challenge: 9.75/10

The problem was deemed highly challenging and interesting, scoring a 9.75 out of 10.

---

## Completion: 10/10

We accomplished all that we set out to do in our proposal, achieving a full score of 10 out of 10.

---

## Implementation: 10/10

Our use of AI techniques was appropriate, and the code was well-written and clear to understand, earning a score of 10 out of 10.

---

## Assessment/Analysis

We measured our progress through iterative improvement of the heuristic, playtesting against it, comparing with previous versions, and developing a highly modular and user-friendly function. Users can vary difficulty by adjusting the depth of the min-max alpha-beta optimized pruning search.

---

## Utility

We believe this project could be converted into a course module for the next CSC320. The code serves as a great introduction to the Konane project and excites students about a no-training AI algorithm capable of determining viable moves through a simple search algorithm. We introduced the game to friends, and it has become highly engaging, with some now challenging the level 10 AI.
